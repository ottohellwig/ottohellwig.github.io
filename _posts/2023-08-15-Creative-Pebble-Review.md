After looking for budget speakers to alleviate my eardrums from being damaged by closed-back active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones, I stumbled upon the Creative Pebble while browsing Umart. So I decided to pick these $20 pair of speakers up and give my humble opinions in addition to testing them for myself. So here's the rundown:

### Pros

- Stylish and Space-Saving Design: The Creative Pebble 2.0 speakers boast a sleek, modern design that complements various setups, whether it's a clutter-free workspace or a minimalist entertainment area.
- Decent Audio Performance: Considering their compact size, the Pebble 2.0 speakers deliver surprisingly clear and balanced audio across the frequency range. They handle mid-tones and vocals exceptionally well, making them suitable for everyday listening and casual gaming.
- Ease of Use: Setting up the Pebble 2.0 speakers is a breeze; simply connect them to your device via a single USB cable for both power and audio. The built-in volume knob provides convenient control, and there's no need for additional software installation.
- Affordable Price Point: The Pebble 2.0 speakers offer good value for the audio quality they provide. They're a cost-effective solution for enhancing audio without breaking the bank.
- Angled Drivers for Enhanced Sound Projection: The speakers' 45-degree angle design ensures that sound is directed towards the user, resulting in an immersive listening experience.

### Cons

- Limited Bass: Due to their compact size, the Pebble 2.0 speakers lack significant bass presence. While they handle mid and high frequencies well, deep bass enthusiasts might find the overall audio profile a bit lacking.
- Not Ideal for Large Spaces: These speakers are best suited for smaller rooms or personal setups. In larger spaces, they might struggle to fill the area with sound adequately.
- No Bluetooth Connectivity: Unlike some competitors, the Pebble 2.0 speakers rely solely on a wired USB connection. This limits their versatility, as they can't connect wirelessly to smartphones or other Bluetooth-enabled devices.

### Verdict

The Creative Pebble 2.0 speakers are a charming addition to any desktop or small entertainment setup. Their stylish design, ease of use, and commendable audio performance make them a suitable choice for those looking to upgrade from built-in monitor or laptop speakers. While the lack of robust bass and Bluetooth connectivity might be a drawback for some users, the Pebble 2.0 speakers offer solid value for their price point. Whether you're streaming music, watching videos, or engaging in light gaming, these speakers provide a refreshing audio experience that belies their compact size. Further, at a price which is practically irresistible, they are a welcome addition to my desktop setup.
