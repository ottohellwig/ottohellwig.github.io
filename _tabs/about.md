Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Otto Hellwig, a Bachelor of Information Technology student at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT), with a major in Computer Science. I'm thrilled to be on this journey of exploring the exciting world of technology!

As a passionate developer, I constantly seek opportunities to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of computer science. I believe that creativity and experimentation are the keys to innovation, and I love to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I'm also involved in the world of entrepreneurship. I am a partner at SB Professional Painting, where I contribute my skills to run and grow the business. Additionally, I work as a labourer at AWX, where I gain hands-on experience and valuable insights into different aspects of the workforce.

Through my blog, I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and insights with the community. You'll find a mix of tech-related content, creative projects, and musings on my blog. Join me as we embark on this adventure together!

Feel free to reach out and connect. Let's learn and create together! ðŸš€
